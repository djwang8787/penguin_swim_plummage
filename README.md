# penguins-swim-study
objective of the study was to examine how/if the increase in swimming behaviour contributes to weight loss in three different species of penguins.

Proposal:
1. To only focus on the KPs and NHRP(?) as they are the only species that participated in the study. Not all KPs participated and the sole NHRP did participate.
2. Gentoos did not participate, and so they are removed from the overall analysis.
2.1 There could be some use with including Gentoos, for e.g., to demonstrate that the effects of time did not play a role in the overall gain in weight as well as plumage score. But this is already supplemented by data from the KPs.
